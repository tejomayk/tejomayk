# Hello World! 👋 

I'm a Data Science graduate student in New York, passionate about transforming raw data into meaningful insights and building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. My journey combines a strong foundation in Statistics with hands-on experience in Machine Learning and AI.

## 🚀 What I'm Currently Working On

I'm diving deep into the world of Natural Language Processing at a NYC-based AI startup, where I'm:
- Exploring the fascinating realm of Named Entity Recognition using state-of-the-art transformer architectures
- Building and optimizing deep learning models that understand text better than ever before
- Conducting research to push the boundaries of what's possible with NLP

## 🛠️ My Tech Universe

### AI & Machine Learning
When it comes to making machines learn, I love working with:
- Deep Learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch
- Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision
