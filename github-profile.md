# Hello World! 👋 

I'm a Data Science graduate student in New York, learing how to build intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. My journey combines a strong foundation in Statistics with hands-on experience in Machine Learning and AI.

## 🚀 What I'm Currently Working On

I'm diving deep into the world of Natural Language Processing at a NYC-based AI startup, where I'm:
- Exploring the fascinating realm of Named Entity Recognition using state-of-the-art transformer architectures
- Building and optimizing deep learning models that understand text better than ever before
- Conducting research to push the boundaries of what's possible with NLP

## 🛠️ My Tech Universe

### AI & Machine Learning
When it comes to making machines learn, I love working with:
- Deep Learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch
- Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision
- Large Language Models and Generative AI
- Time Series Analysis and Predictive Modeling

### Data Engineering & Tools
I believe in building robust data pipelines using:
- Big Data tools like Hadoop and PySpark
- Workflow orchestration with Airflow
- Both SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB, Neo4j) databases

### Programming Languages
I'm fluent in:
- Python (my go-to for data science and ML)
- R (for statistical analysis)

I'm familiar with:
- Javascript
- Java
- C


## 🌱 What I'm Learning

I'm currently exploring:
- Advanced applications of Large Language Models
- MLOps and deployment strategies
- Cloud-native machine learning architectures
